Project Description: Experimenting with Date Converter, Date Calculation, and Static HTML Reservation using JavaScript

Introduction:
This project was designed as a university exercise to explore the concepts of date conversion, date calculation, and implementing a reservation system. Utilizing basic web technologies such as static HTML and JavaScript, we developed a simple yet functional application to demonstrate these skills.

Key Features:

Date Conversion: The application allows users to input dates in different formats (e.g., day/month/year or month/day/year) and convert them between each other. This feature helps in understanding the differences in date formats and performing accurate conversions.

Date Calculation: Using JavaScript, the application provides the ability to calculate dates by adding or subtracting a certain number of days from a given date. This can be useful in various scenarios such as event planning or deadline management.

Reservation System: One of the main highlights of the project is the implementation of a rudimentary reservation system. Users can select a date from a calendar and make a reservation for that date. This feature puts into practice the concepts of handling user data and event management in JavaScript.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Used for the basic structure of the web application.
CSS: Added for styling and presentation of the user interface.
JavaScript: Programming logic is written in JavaScript to make the application interactive.
JavaScript libraries (if any): Some JavaScript libraries may be used to simplify certain tasks, such as date manipulation or creating dynamic user interface elements.
Learning Objectives:

Understanding of date formats and conversions between them.
Mastery of date calculation operations in JavaScript.
Practical experience with HTML and CSS for creating user interfaces.
Learning the basics of event handling and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
Learning web development best practices, including separation of concerns and code maintainability.
Conclusion:

This university exercise project provides hands-on experience for students looking to deepen their understanding of date conversions, date calculations, and creating interactive user interfaces using basic web technologies. By implementing a simple yet functional reservation system, participants have the opportunity to solidify their front-end programming skills while becoming familiar with the fundamental concepts of web development.
